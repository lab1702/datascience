This adds many packages, and a Jupyter Notebook server, to the rocker/geospatial image.

It also includes some customization, such as RStudio defaults and theme.

# Usage

As configured, it is meant to be run on a private network and only accessed from localhost since Jupyter is being run without a password.

The sample run batchfile also runs RStudio without a password.

Once it's running, access RStudio at http://localhost:8787/ and Jupyter Notebook at http://localhost:8888/
